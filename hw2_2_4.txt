The New York Times is the easier domain because it has a low type/token ratio, that means that it is repetitive and there are not many new types, it also has a low entropy which indicates high predictability. The next easier domain is cancer, then obesity. A domain is then more readable if it has a low type/token ration, low entropy, small vocab_size, low frac_freq, short median_word or average_word and therefore high frac_nyt since it is characterized by easy readability and contains easy vocabulary.
