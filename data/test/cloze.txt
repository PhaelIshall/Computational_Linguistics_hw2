Several cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have recently been shown to display anticancer activity via a mechanism that usually entails the disruption of cancer cell membranes. In this work, we designed an 18-residue anticancer peptide, SVS-1, whose mechanism of action is designed to take advantage of the aberrant lipid composition presented on the outer leaflet of cancer cell membranes, which makes the surface of these cells electronegative relative to the surface of noncancerous cells. SVS-1 is designed to remain unfolded and inactive in aqueous solution but to preferentially fold at the surface of cancer cells, adopting an amphiphilic Î²-hairpin structure capable of membrane disruption. Membrane-induced folding is driven by electrostatic interaction between the peptide and the negatively charged membrane surface of cancer cells. SVS-1 is active against a variety of cancer cell lines such as A549 (lung carcinoma), KB (epidermal carcinoma), MCF-7 (breast carcinoma), and MDA-MB-436 (breast carcinoma). However, the cytotoxicity toward noncancerous cells having typical membrane compositions, such as HUVEC and erythrocytes, is low. CD spectroscopy, appropriately designed peptide controls, cell-based studies, liposome leakage assays, and electron microscopy support the intended mechanism of action, which leads to preferential killing of cancerous cells.
Limited data suggest that people with the metabolic syndrome have lower intakes or circulating concentrations of magnesium than those who do not have the syndrome. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between dietary intake of magnesium and the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. We used data for 7669 participants&> or =20 years of age of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988 to 1994). The metabolic syndrome was defined using the criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program. Magnesium intake was determined from a single dietary 24-hour recall. The unadjusted prevalences of the metabolic syndrome were 29.0% (quintile of lowest magnesium intake), 27.5%, 25.8%, 23.9%, and 21.8% for increasing quintiles of magnesium intake (p for trend = 0.002). After multiple adjustment, the odds ratios for the second through the fifth quintiles (highest intake) of magnesium intake among all participants included in the analysis were 0.84 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.58, 1.23], 0.76 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.07), 0.62 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.98), and 0.56 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.92), respectively (p for trend = 0.029). The associations were similar for men and women. Our results showing an inverse association between dietary magnesium intake and the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome add to the evidence that adequate magnesium intake or a diet rich in magnesium may be important for maintaining good cardiometabolic health.
Gel filtration of human serum extracts on Bio-Gel P-30 columns produced two peaks of material reactive with insulin antisera. The earlier eluting fraction appeared at the elution position of proinsulin (serum proinsulin-like component, PLC) while the second fraction corresponded in elution volume to insulin. In assays using porcine insulin-(131)I and an antiserum against porcine insulin, human pancreatic proinsulin was less reactive than human insulin. Serial dilutions of the serum PLC in the immunoassay showed immunological identity with the human proinsulin standard. Partial tryptic digestion of the serum PLC yielded products with increased immunological reactivity as estimated with insulin as the standard. With larger amounts of trypsin, all the serum PLC was converted to insulin-like components (desthreonine and desoctapeptide insulin). On the basis of these results we conclude that the earlier eluting fraction of human serum extracts is proinsulin. The fasting values of proinsulin in normal subjects ranged between 0.05 and 0.4 ng/ml, representing from 5 to 48% of the insulin concentration. In one subject the values of proinsulin were higher than those of insulin. After oral administration of 100 g of glucose, the proinsulin levels tended to rise similarly to insulin. Three obese patients with hyperinsulinemia had higher fasting levels of proinsulin and a greater increase after glucose than the normal subjects. As the high levels of proinsulin coexisted with raised insulin concentration in these obese subjects, the relative proportions of the two hormones were in the same range observed in the normal group. Thus hyperinsulinemia in these obese subjects was not accompanied by an increase in the fraction of serum proinsulin. When the values for serum proinsulin were expressed as percentage of the insulin levels, there was a decrease in the per cent proinsulin in the first hour of the glucose tolerance test. After the second hour, the per cent tended to rise towards the fasting levels.
Tumor cells can evade the immune system through several mechanisms, one of which is to block DC maturation. It has been suggested that signaling via Toll-like receptors (TLR) may be involved in the induction of prophylactic anti-cancer immunity and in the treatment of established tumors. In the present study we found that high numbers of tumor cells interfere with BMDC activation induced by the TLR ligands LPS and poly IC. Tumor cells blocked TLR3- and TLR4-mediated induction of MHCII and the co-stimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86, as well as the cytokines IL-12, TNF-alpha and IL-6. Importantly, tumor cells induced inhibitory molecules (B7-DC, B7-H1 and CD80) on spleen DC in vivo and on BMDC, even in the presence of TLR ligands. Moreover, after a long exposure with tumor cells, purified BMDC were unable to respond to a second challenge with TLR ligands. The failure of tumor exposed-BMDC to express co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines in the presence of TLR ligands has implications for the future development of DC-based cancer immune therapies using TLR ligands as adjuvants for the activation of DC.
Pre-existing anti-adenovirus neutralizing antibodies (AdNAbs) are a major barrier in clinical gene therapy using adenovirus vectors; however, the transduction profile of adenovirus vectors in the presence of AdNAbs following intratumoral injection has not been fully examined, although such vectors are often intratumorally injected in clinical studies. In this study, we evaluated the correlation between the titer of AdNAbs in the serum and the transduction profiles in the tumor and the liver following intratumoral administration into mice possessing various titers of AdNAbs. Adenovirus vector-mediated transduction in the tumor was inhibited by AdNAbs; however, when the titer of AdNAbs was less than 200, the levels of inhibition in the transduction efficiencies within the tumor ranged from approximately 2- to 100-fold. A more than 2500-fold reduction of adenovirus vector-mediated transduction was found in most of the mice when the titers of AdNAbs were >200. On the other hand, the transduction efficiencies in the liver were largely reduced almost to the levels of the mock-transduced mice even at the low titers of AdNAbs. These results provide crucial information for the clinical use of adenovirus vectors.
A number of algorithms have been developed to correct for migration time drift in capillary electrophoresis. Those algorithms require identification of common components in each run. However, not all components may be present or resolved in separations of complex samples, which can confound attempts for alignment. This paper reports the use of fluorescein thiocarbamyl derivatives of amino acids as internal standards for alignment of 3-(2-furoyl)quinoline-2-carboxaldehyde (FQ)-labeled proteins in capillary sieving electrophoresis. The fluorescein thiocarbamyl derivative of aspartic acid migrates before FQ-labeled proteins and the fluorescein thiocarbamyl derivative of arginine migrates after the FQ-labeled proteins. These compounds were used as internal standards to correct for variations in migration time over a two-week period in the separation of a cellular homogenate. The experimental conditions were deliberately manipulated by varying electric field and sample preparation conditions. Three components of the homogenate were used to evaluate the alignment efficiency. Before alignment, the average relative standard deviation in migration time for these components was 13.3%. After alignment, the average relative standard deviation in migration time for these components was reduced to 0.5%.
The present investigation was designed to determine whether the circadian rhythm of glucose utilization is based on a quantitatively different release of insulin and/or on changing secretory dynamics of the hormone. 22 healthy men received three oral glucose tolerance tests in the morning, afternoon and evening of the same day. The blood sugar levels in the afternoon and evening tests were significantly higher than those found in the morning tests. Also the plasma insulin response was higher in the afternoon than in the evening, but it showed a delayed rise and late peak response. In the evening the normal subjects responded as mild diabetics.
The aim of the work was the synthesis of gold nanoparticles (GNP) of different sizes and the estimation of their biological activity in vitro and in vivo.  Water dispersions of gold nanoparticles of different sizes have been synthesized by Davis method and characterized by laser-correlation spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy methods. The GNP interaction with tumor cells has been visualized by confocal microscopy method. The enzyme activity was determined by standard biochemical methods. GNP distribution and content in organs and tissues have been determined via atomic-absorption spectrometry method; genotoxic influence has been estimated by "Comet-assay" method.  The GNP size-dependent accumulation in cultured U937 tumor cells and their ability to modulate U937 cell membrane Na(+),K(+)-ÐÐ¢Ð -ase activity value has been revealed in vitro. Using in vivo model of Guerin carcinoma it has been shown that GNP possess high affinity to tumor cells.  Our results indicate the perspectives of use of the synthesized GNP water dispersions for cancer diagnostics and treatment. It's necessary to take into account a size-dependent biosafety level of nanoparticles.
Lipids and cholesterol in particular, have long been associated with breast cancer (BC) onset and progression. However, the causative effects of elevated lipid levels and breast cancer remain largely undisclosed and were the subject of the present study.We took advantage of well-established in vitro and in vivo models of cholesterol enrichment to exploit the mechanism involved in LDL-cholesterol favouring BC growth and invasiveness. We analyzed its effects in models that mimic different BC subtypes and stages.Our data show that LDL-cholesterol (but not HDL-cholesterol) promotes BC cells proliferation, migration and loss of adhesion, hallmarks of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. In vivo studies modeling cholesterol levels showed that breast tumors are consistently larger and more proliferative in hypercholesterolemic mice, which also have more frequently lung metastases. Microarray analysis revealed an over expression of intermediates of Akt and ERK pathways suggesting a survival response induced by LDL, confirmed by WB analyses. Gene expression analysis also evidenced an activation of ErbB2 signaling pathway and decreased expression of adhesion molecules (cadherin-related family member3, CD226, Claudin 7 and Ocludin) in the cells exposed to LDL.Together, the present work shows novel mechanistic evidence that high LDL-cholesterol levels promote BC progression. These data provide rationale for the clinical control of cholesterol levels in BC patients.
Madelung's disease, or multiple symmetric lipomatosis, is an extremely rare disease and very likely to be under-diagnosed. It is characterized by multiple symmetrical non-encapsulated fat accumulations mainly located around the neck, shoulders, upper extremities and upper parts of the trunk. The disorder predominantly affects middle-aged men of Mediterranean origin with a history of ethanol intake. Reports of this uncommon disorder in women are very rare. The aim of this article is to report the endocrine and metabolic workup leading to the diagnosis of this uncommon disorder. A 55-year-old woman with osteoporosis was referred to our outpatient clinic with a suspected diagnosis of Cushing's disease. The patient complained of undesired weight gain with atypical fat accumulations predominantly in the upper trunk region during the previous 10 weeks. She presented with the characteristic physical features of Madelung's disease and underwent a thorough examination with endocrine and metabolic evaluation of this rare condition and was finally diagnosed with Madelung's disease. This report demonstrates how a diagnosis of this rare disorder can be reached efficiently. A history of osteoporosis in combination with weight gain and atypical fat accumulations ultimately led to the diagnosis of Madelung's diseases, a rather unknown disorder likely to be under-diagnosed. Although treatment options are limited, a diagnosis is still important for the affected individual.
Based on "quantitative pharmaco-EEG" using computer-analyzed EEG (CEEG) measurements, unknown CNS effects of lisuride hydrogen maleate (LHM) were established. CEEG profiles of LHM in low dosages (less than or equal to 10 mcg) are similar to CNS "inhibitory" compounds, while in higher dosages (25 mcg to 100 mcg) they resemble "psychostimulant" compounds. By measuring the brain function using computer period analysis of cerebral biopotentials, dose-efficacy relations were found (in the range of 25-75 mcg) which suggest the bioavailability of LHM at the CNS level. By comparing the CEEG profiles of LHM with the previously studied compounds, five different clinical uses of LHM were predicted. The pilot trials suggest that LHM may have therapeutic potentials in patients with "aging" and/or organic brain syndromes, and in children with behavioral disturbances.
Body mass index (BMI) is the pragmatic measure to assess children's obesity clinically and BMI charts are widely used for counselling families about children's weight management over time.  To explore the variability in clinicians' interpretation of BMI patterns and to ascertain the diagnostic accuracy of their judgement by relating it to change in body composition by dual-emission x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).  Data from 70 children who participated in a trial of a weight management programme for obese children were analysed. BMI was plotted on UK 1990 charts at baseline, 6 months and 12 months, and four clinicians experienced in obesity management independently scored the charts on a five-point scale for how successful children were in tackling their obesity over a 6-month period. Scores were compared with change in BMI, fat mass and lean mass z-scores as measured by DXA.  54 children (aged 8-15 years; BMI z-score 2.93 (SD 0.48)) had simultaneous BMI and DXA scans performed, giving 104 pairs of measurements 6 months apart. There was good consistency between clinicians' scores for weight management and these related well to change in BMI and fat mass z-scores, but not lean mass z-score. They reported that measurement proximity to centile lines and crossing of lines influenced their confidence in making a decision and change in severe obesity was harder to judge as higher centile lines are so far apart.  BMI charts are useful for assessing children's attempts at weight management, and provide a reasonably accurate indication of change in body fat. Recommendations are made regarding BMI chart design and guidance in interpreting measurements.
This study specifies a strategy to improve radiotherapy by partial synchronization of p53-deficient cancer cells (FaDu and H1299) in mitosis using taxol, with protecting p53 wild-type cells (A549) by the prior administration of cytostatic compounds. Cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of ionizing radiation, cisplatin, doxorubicin and taxol, administrated alone or in combination were investigated in vitro by flow cytometry.  A protective effect of doxorubicin but not cisplatin was found after administration of triple sequence with ionizing radiation and taxol. It was found that preliminary administration of doxorubicin induced growth arrest and protected A549 cells from the taxol/radiation treatment, while simultaneously killing FaDu and H1299 cells.  The proposed therapeutic strategy allows protection of p53 wild-type cells and selectively increases radiosensitivity of p53-deficient cancer cells.
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is one of the most common chemotherapeutic agents used for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, chemoresistance has precluded the use of 5-FU alone in clinical regimens. Combination therapies with 5-FU and other anticancer agents are considered to be a therapeutic option for patients with HCC. We previously reported that the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) can decrease the sensitivity of HCC cells to 5-FU. To overcome this problem, in this study, we elucidated the mechanism underlying EGFRvIII-mediated 5-FU resistance. We observed that EGFRvIII expression can induce miR-520d-3p downregulation and the ensuing upregulation of the transcription factor E2F-1 and the enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS), which may lead to drug resistance. Intriguingly, we found that CH12, a monoclonal antibody directed against EGFRvIII, and 5-FU together had an additive antitumor effect on EGFRvIII-positive HCC xenografts and significantly improved survival in all mice with established tumors when compared with either 5-FU or CH12 alone. Mechanistically, compared with 5-FU alone, the combination more noticeably downregulated EGFR phosphorylation and Akt phosphorylation as well as the expression of the apoptotic protector Bcl-xL and the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1. Additionally, the combination upregulated the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 in in vivo treatment. More interestingly, CH12 treatment upregulated miR-520-3p and downregulated E2F-1 and TS at the mRNA and protein levels. Collectively, these observations suggest that the combination of 5-FU with mAb CH12 is a potential means of circumventing EGFRvIII-mediated 5-FU resistance in HCC.
Physical activity has been associated with the prevention and control of several medial conditions that are major causes of death and disability in the United States. The criterion-based approach adopted by the US Preventive Services Task Force is used to objectively evaluate the evidence regarding the effectiveness of physical activity counseling for healthy adults as a primary preventive intervention in the clinical setting. This evaluation addresses: (1) the burden of suffering attributable to physical inactivity; (2) the efficacy of physical activity in disease prevention in regard to six medical conditions; and (3) the characteristics of the intervention in terms of simplicity, cost, safety, acceptability, and patient compliance. Based on consideration of the evidence for each of these issues, specific recommendations are made regarding the role of physical activity counseling in routine clinical practice. In addition, practical guidelines are presented to aid clinicians in physical activity counseling.
Apart from assessing the nutrition status, the diagnosis of obesity also includes the assessment of mass and distribution of adipose tissue which provides revealing of latent types of obesity that hold higher health risks. The aim of our study was to assess the nutritional status and to analyze the prevalence of normal weight obesity and abdominal obesity in students from the University of Novi Sad.  The body mass index, waist circumference and body fat mass were assessed in the group of 371 students from the University of Novi Sad (their average age being 22.9 +/- 2.5 y).  One-fifth of the study sample students were found to be overweight and obese, i.e. 21% and 1.1%, respectively. The frequency of overweight and obesity was higher in male respondents (overweight: 41.67% vs. 6.05%; obesity: 1.92% vs. 0.46%). Among the survey respondents, there were 4.6% of underweight students, all of whom were female students. Body fat was found to be increased in 11% of the students, the frequency being higher in the males. The phenomenon of obesity in normal body mass was recorded in 7% of the respondents, being more frequent in female students. The total of 5.6% of female students and 5.8% of male students had abdominal obesity.  The survey results indicate the necessity and obligation to direct attention to regular and complete diagnostics of obesity in order to determine the size of fat body mass and its distribution. The presence of obesity in normal body mass among young, student population requires the comprehensive, detailed and timely diagnosis and treatment of this disease.
Assessing the pharmacodynamics (PD) of a potential therapeutic through the use of a downstream biomarker is essential. This is traditionally performed in the target tissue but limited volume and invasiveness of sampling pose challenges with solid tumours. Currently, there are several small molecule receptor kinase inhibitors and large molecule therapeutic antibodies in clinical trials that interfere with TGFbeta signalling to treat various forms of cancer. With the advent of these new therapies, there is a need for a surrogate tissue that is easily accessible and indicative of tumour response. We propose the use of an ex vivo TGFbeta1 stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) coupled with the measurement of phosphorylated SMAD2 (Sma/Mothers Against dpp, a downstream transcriptional activator) using a sandwich ELISA. TGFbeta is involved in many different cellular responses, such as proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, invasion and immunomodulation. SMAD2 and SMAD3 are phosphorylated as a result of the canonical cascade through ligand binding and receptor kinase activation. These phosphorylated SMADs (pSMAD) associate with SMAD4, a co-SMAD, and transcriptionally activate TGFbeta-mediated genes. This paper describes the novel method for measuring the downstream effects of inhibiting canonical TGFbeta signalling using ex vivo stimulation of surrogate tissue to predict tumour response. In addition, we present the assay validation rationale and data. This novel, validated assay can be used to gain insight into clinical trials regarding TGFbeta signal modulation by multiple inhibitor platforms for both large and small molecules.
Diastolic heart failure is defined clinically when signs and symptoms of heart failure are present in the presence of preserved left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction&>45%). The incidence and prevalence of primary diastolic heart failure increases with age and it may be as high as 50% in the elderly. Age, female gender, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and increased body mass index are risk factors for diastolic heart failure. Hemodynamic consequences such as increased pulmonary venous pressure, post-capillary pulmonary hypertension, and secondary right heart failure as well as decreased cardiac output are similar to those of systolic left ventricular failure, although the nature of primary left ventricular dysfunction is different. Diagnosis of primary diastolic heart failure depends on the presence of preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. Assessment of diastolic dysfunction is preferable but not mandatory. It is to be noted that increased levels of B-type natriuretic peptide does not distinguish between diastolic and systolic heart failure. Echocardiographic studies are recommended to exclude hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, infiltrative heart disease, primary valvular heart disease, and constrictive pericarditis. Myocardial stress imaging is frequently required to exclude ischemic heart disease. The prognosis of diastolic heart failure is variable; it is related to age, severity of heart failure, and associated comorbid diseases such as coronary artery disease. The prognosis of severe diastolic heart failure is similar to that of systolic heart failure. However, cautious use of diuretics and/or nitrates may cause hypotension and low output state. Heart rate control is essential to improving ventricular filling. Pharmacologic agents such as angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers are used in selected patients to decrease left ventricular hypertrophy. To decrease myocardial fibrosis, aldosterone antagonists have a potential therapeutic role. However, prospective controlled studies will be required to establish their efficacy in primary diastolic heart failure.
Exogenous obesity increases morbidity and mortality risk and has been associated with nutritional habits, which in turn can be affected by health education. Health education aims to promote patient participation in achieving behavior change and healthy lifestyles. The objective of this study is to show the advantages of participatory education in the modification of body mass index (BMI) in obese type-2 diabetics. A quasi-experimental study was performed with random allocation of two patient groups. The educational intervention was organized through a reflection-action process. BMI was measured at baseline and then monthly for 9 months during the intervention. The groups were analyzed by age and sex. Statistical analysis used the Student t test, with the mean difference for related groups. The control group showed a mean BMI of 33.89 + 1.96 and a final BMI of 33.2 +/- 2.15 (t:22.4; p:0.16). The experimental group had an initial value of 33.63 +/- 2.12 and a final BMI of 31.54 +/- 1.71; statistical difference: (t:11.55; p:0.003). The participatory educational intervention thus helped improve the BMI in obese type-2 diabetics.
Anticancer drugs are effective against tumors that depend on the molecular target of the drug. Known targets of cytotoxic anticancer drugs are involved in cell proliferation; drugs acting on such targets are ineffective against nonproliferating tumor cells, survival of which leads to eventual therapy failure. Function-based genomic screening identified the coatomer protein complex Î¶1 (COPZ1) gene as essential for different tumor cell types but not for normal cells. COPZ1 encodes a subunit of coatomer protein complex 1 (COPI) involved in intracellular traffic and autophagy. The knockdown of COPZ1, but not of COPZ2 encoding isoform coatomer protein complex Î¶2, caused Golgi apparatus collapse, blocked autophagy, and induced apoptosis in both proliferating and nondividing tumor cells. In contrast, inhibition of normal cell growth required simultaneous knockdown of both COPZ1 and COPZ2. COPZ2 (but not COPZ1) was down-regulated in the majority of tumor cell lines and in clinical samples of different cancer types. Reexpression of COPZ2 protected tumor cells from killing by COPZ1 knockdown, indicating that tumor cell dependence on COPZ1 is the result of COPZ2 silencing. COPZ2 displays no tumor-suppressive activities, but it harbors microRNA 152, which is silenced in tumor cells concurrently with COPZ2 and acts as a tumor suppressor in vitro and in vivo. Silencing of microRNA 152 in different cancers and the ensuing down-regulation of its host gene COPZ2 offer a therapeutic opportunity for proliferation-independent selective killing of tumor cells by COPZ1-targeting agents.
Stimuli-responsive hydrogels have attracted considerable interest in the field of microfluidics due to their ability to transform electrical energy directly into mechanical work through swelling, bending, and other deformations. In particular, electroactive hydrogels hold great promise for biomedical micropumping applications such as implantable drug delivery systems. In such applications, energy consumption rate and durability are key properties. Here, we developed a valveless micropump system that utilizes a hydrogel as the main actuator, and tested its performance over 6 months of continuous operation. The proposed micropump system, powered by a single 1.5 V commercial battery, expended very little energy (less than 750 Î¼Ws per stroke) while pumping 0.9 wt% saline solution under a low voltage (less than 1 V), and remained fully functional after 6 months. CFD simulations were conducted to improve the microchannel geometry so as to minimize the backflow caused by the valveless mechanism of the system. Based on the simulation results, an asymmetric geometry and a stop post were introduced to enhance the pumping performance. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system as a drug delivery pump, an anti-cancer drug (adriamycin) was perfused to human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) using the pump. The present study showed that the proposed system can operate continuously for long periods with low energy consumption, powered by a single 1.5 V battery, making it a promising candidate for an implantable drug delivery system.
Obese patients have many physical limitations and much psychiatric burden to overcome. Several studies have shown that the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in the obese is similar to those with normal weight. However, in obese patients seeking treatment there is an increased prevalence (40-60%) of psychiatric morbidity, most commonly depression. It is difficult to separate the effects of depression on obesity and, on the contrary, the neuroendocrine changes associated with stress and depression may cause metabolic changes that predispose and perpetuate obesity. The stigma associated with obesity causes bullying in school as well as childhood psychiatric morbidity. Prejudice is not limited to the general public but exists among health professionals too. This chapter discusses the treatment of depression in obesity and the psychiatric evaluation of the pre-bariatric surgery patient. Education of society, starting with schools and including healthcare professionals will reduce bias and stigma as well as assist this vulnerable group of patients to seek help for their obesity and the many problems that come with it. Given that by the year 2025 obesity will be the world's number one health problem with the US leading the way, it is very important that we pursue preventive measures as well as encourage research for treatments of obesity.
Studies of endovascular renal denervation (RDN) have demonstrated significant blood pressure reduction in eligible patients with resistant hypertension. These trials have used stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria in patient enrollment, potentially selecting for a small subset of patients with resistant hypertension. In this study, we examined the changes in estimated prevalence of resistant hypertension when using increasingly stringent definitions of resistant hypertension in a fixed population and assessed the generalizability of RDN when applying study criteria to a community-based hypertensive population.  A retrospective chart review was done of hypertensive outpatients. Four increasingly stringent interpretations of the American Heart Association definition of resistant hypertension were used to calculate prevalence estimates. Patients eligible for RDN were identified using criteria from SYMPLICITY HTN-3. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared.  We identified 1,756 hypertensive outpatients; 55.0% were male, 53.9% were white, and subjects had a mean age of 66.6 Â± 12.5 years and a body mass index (BMI) of 30.1 Â± 10.7 kg/m(2). Only 14 (0.8%) were eligible for RDN. Among these patients, 10 (71.4%) were female and all were black, with a mean age of 69.9 Â± 8.8 and BMI of 35.7 Â± 6.6. Congestive heart failure was more common in patients eligible for RDN.  Patients eligible for RDN based on published studies represent an exceedingly small proportion of the total hypertensive population. Further studies are necessary to determine if the benefits of RDN can be generalized to a broader range of hypertensive patients than those included in previous trials.
Deguelin, a naturally occurring rotenoid, is known to be an Akt inhibitor and to have an anti-tumor effect on several cancers.  This study was performed to elucidate the effect of deguelin on apoptotic pathways related to NF-ÎºB signaling in colon cancer cells and on the anti-tumor effect in colon cancer xenograft mice.  We studied COLO 205 and HCT116 cells in the presence or absence of deguelin. NF-ÎºB signaling was examined by real-time RT-PCR for interleukin (IL)-8, by Western blotting for IÎºB phosphorylation/degradation, and by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Cell death was determined by the MTT assay, and apoptosis by Annexin V-FITC staining and caspase-3 activity. We also assessed the expression of antiapoptotic and proapoptotic factors by use of RT-PCR. In colon cancer xenograft mice, we evaluated the effect of deguelin on inoculated tumor growth, and apoptotic index was measured by the in vivo TUNEL assay.  Deguelin significantly inhibited IL-8 gene expression, IÎºB phosphorylation/degradation, and DNA binding activity of NF-ÎºB in colon cancer cells. Deguelin induced cell death and apoptosis in colon cancer cells in a dose and time-dependent manner. Deguelin down-regulated expression of NF-ÎºB-mediated antiapoptotic factors such as cFLIP, Bcl-2, and Bcl-X(L). In the colon cancer xenograft model, the volume of the tumor treated with deguelin was significantly lower than that of the control, and the apoptotic index for deguelin-treated mice was much higher.  Deguelin might be a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of colorectal cancer.
A convergent synthesis of a novel estrogen receptor-targeted drug hybrid was developed based on structures of the potent anti-proliferative mitomycin C and the steroidal anti-estrogen RU 39411. The steroidal antiestrogen was prepared with an azido-triethylene glycoloxy linker while the mitomycin C derivative (porfirimycin) incorporated a complementary 7-N-terminal alkyne. The two components were ligated using the Huisgen [3 + 2] cycloaddition ("click") reaction. Preliminary biological assays demonstrated that the final hybrid compound retained both potent anti-estrogenic and anti-proliferative activities.
Adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP) plays a key role in obesity-related insulin resistance and inflammation which may be involved in the pathogenesis of sarcopenic obesity (SO). This study examined the association of SO with serum A-FABP levels in Korean adults.  Two hundred ninety eight adults aged 20-70 years were examined using dual X-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography and measuring serum A-FABP levels. Sarcopenia was defined as the appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) divided by weight (%) of &< SD below the mean values of young adults in both sexes. Obesity was defined as visceral fat area (VFA) â¥ 100 cm(2).  Serum A-FABP levels were higher in groups with SO compared to non-SO groups in both men and women. In the unadjusted model, serum A-FABP levels were positively associated with VFA and negatively associated with ASM/weight. Even after adjusting for possible confounding factors, ASM/weight was found to be independently and negatively associated with serum A-FABP levels. In addition, multiple logistic regression analysis showed that increased serum levels of A-FABP were independently associated with the presence of SO.  The present findings indicate that serum A-FABP levels may be valuable markers of the presence of SO.
In this study, we applied near-infrared fluorescent quantum dots (NIRF-QDs) for non-invasive in vivo and in situ imaging of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The U14 squamous cancer cell line with high expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was implanted subcutaneously into the head and neck regions of nude mice to establish HNSCC models. NIRF-QDs with an emission wavelength of 800 nm (NIRF-QD800) were conjugated with EGFR monoclonal antibodies to develop the QD800-EGFR Ab probe. In vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that the QD800-EGFR Ab probe can specifically bind EGFR expressed on U14 cells. U14 squamous cell carcinoma in the head and neck can be clearly visualized by in vivo imaging after intravenous injection of QD800-EGFR Ab probes. The results suggested that in situ imaging using NIRF-QD-EGFR Ab probes has unique advantages and prospects for the investigation of tumor development, early diagnosis and personalized therapy of HNSCC.
Identifying neighborhood environment attributes related to childhood obesity can inform environmental changes for obesity prevention.  To evaluate child and parent weight status across neighborhoods in King County (Seattle metropolitan area) and San Diego County differing in GIS-defined physical activity environment (PAE) and nutrition environment (NE) characteristics.  Neighborhoods were selected to represent high (favorable) versus low (unfavorable) on the two measures, forming four neighborhood types (low on both measures, low PAE/high NE, high PAE/low NE, and high on both measures). Weight and height of children aged 6-11 years and one parent (n=730) from selected neighborhoods were assessed in 2007-2009. Differences in child and parent overweight and obesity by neighborhood type were examined, adjusting for neighborhood-, family-, and individual-level demographics.  Children from neighborhoods high on both environment measures were less likely to be obese (7.7% vs 15.9%, OR=0.44, p=0.02) and marginally less likely to be overweight (23.7% vs 31.7%, OR=0.67, p=0.08) than children from neighborhoods low on both measures. In models adjusted for parent weight status and demographic factors, neighborhood environment type remained related to child obesity (high vs low on both measures, OR=0.41, p&<.03). Parents in neighborhoods high on both measures (versus low on both) were marginally less likely to be obese (20.1% vs 27.7%, OR=0.66, p=0.08), although parent overweight did not differ by neighborhood environment. The lower odds of parent obesity in neighborhoods with environments supportive of physical activity and healthy eating remained in models adjusted for demographics (high vs low on the environment measures, OR=0.57, p=0.053).  Findings support the proposed GIS-based definitions of obesogenic neighborhoods for children and parents that consider both physical activity and nutrition environment features.
Apart from assessing the nutrition status, the diagnosis of obesity also includes the assessment of mass and distribution of adipose tissue which provides revealing of latent types of obesity that hold higher health risks. The aim of our study was to assess the nutritional status and to analyze the prevalence of normal weight obesity and abdominal obesity in students from the University of Novi Sad.  The body mass index, waist circumference and body fat mass were assessed in the group of 371 students from the University of Novi Sad (their average age being 22.9 +/- 2.5 y).  One-fifth of the study sample students were found to be overweight and obese, i.e. 21% and 1.1%, respectively. The frequency of overweight and obesity was higher in male respondents (overweight: 41.67% vs. 6.05%; obesity: 1.92% vs. 0.46%). Among the survey respondents, there were 4.6% of underweight students, all of whom were female students. Body fat was found to be increased in 11% of the students, the frequency being higher in the males. The phenomenon of obesity in normal body mass was recorded in 7% of the respondents, being more frequent in female students. The total of 5.6% of female students and 5.8% of male students had abdominal obesity.  The survey results indicate the necessity and obligation to direct attention to regular and complete diagnostics of obesity in order to determine the size of fat body mass and its distribution. The presence of obesity in normal body mass among young, student population requires the comprehensive, detailed and timely diagnosis and treatment of this disease.
Assessing the pharmacodynamics (PD) of a potential therapeutic through the use of a downstream biomarker is essential. This is traditionally performed in the target tissue but limited volume and invasiveness of sampling pose challenges with solid tumours. Currently, there are several small molecule receptor kinase inhibitors and large molecule therapeutic antibodies in clinical trials that interfere with TGFbeta signalling to treat various forms of cancer. With the advent of these new therapies, there is a need for a surrogate tissue that is easily accessible and indicative of tumour response. We propose the use of an ex vivo TGFbeta1 stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) coupled with the measurement of phosphorylated SMAD2 (Sma/Mothers Against dpp, a downstream transcriptional activator) using a sandwich ELISA. TGFbeta is involved in many different cellular responses, such as proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, invasion and immunomodulation. SMAD2 and SMAD3 are phosphorylated as a result of the canonical cascade through ligand binding and receptor kinase activation. These phosphorylated SMADs (pSMAD) associate with SMAD4, a co-SMAD, and transcriptionally activate TGFbeta-mediated genes. This paper describes the novel method for measuring the downstream effects of inhibiting canonical TGFbeta signalling using ex vivo stimulation of surrogate tissue to predict tumour response. In addition, we present the assay validation rationale and data. This novel, validated assay can be used to gain insight into clinical trials regarding TGFbeta signal modulation by multiple inhibitor platforms for both large and small molecules.
The aim of this study was to survey Canadian oncology practitioners' attitudes toward psychosocial concerns and issues in women with breast cancer. Surveys were mailed to 351 medical, radiation and surgical oncologists and 375 oncology nurses. Standard questionnaires assessed attitudes towards psychosocial issues in women with primary and metastatic breast cancer and evaluated the practitioners' willingness to refer women to psychosocial intervention trials in the presence and absence of competing drug trials. Responses were obtained from 74% of those surveyed. Respondents reported being aware of the common occurrence of psychosocial problems in women with metastatic breast cancer, however, physicians were less likely than nurses to offer these women psychosocial support on a prophylactic basis (p &<0.0001) and they expressed greater concern than nurses about scientific validity of (p = 0.0003), and potential psychological damage from (p = 0.005), psychosocial support groups. Nurses were more likely than physicians to favour a study investigating group psychosocial support over competing drug studies (p &<or = 0.003) in the metastatic setting. Physicians were less likely than nurses to deal with weight problems prophylactically in women with primary breast cancer (p = 0.0009) and they expressed greater concern over scientific validity of psychosocial interventions addressing weight than nurses (p = 0.0008); nurses were more concerned about excessive expectations of patients regarding potential benefits of such interventions (p &<0.0001). Regardless, nurses were more likely than physicians to favour a psychosocial intervention study focused on weight management over drug studies in pre- (p = 0.0006) and postmenopausal women (p = 0.05) with primary breast cancer. Canadian oncology practitioners are aware of the common occurrence of psychosocial distress in women with breast cancer. Physicians and nurses assigned differing priorities to psychosocial interventions in both clinical and research situations.
To purify and characterize the colorectal cancer-associated antigen from cultured colorectal cancer cells.  The colorectal cancer cell lines that highly expressed the associated antigen were selected by flow cytometry with five specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) CYL1-5. Western blot was used to determine the binding ability of five mAbs to the associated antigens released from colorectal cells lysed with single or triplex-detergent, respectively. The mAb with highest binding ability was employed as the ligand for the immuno-affinity chromatography. The antigens purified through immuno-affinity chromatography were identified by Western blot.  The associated antigens were highly expressed on the colorectal cancer cell lines Hce-8693. The binding ability of mAb CYL-2 to the antigen was higher than that of CYL-1, CYL-3-5. The purified associated antigen binding to mAb CYL-2 was a heterodimer composed of two subunits with relative molecular mass (M(r)) of 60 x 10(3) and 70 x 10(3), respectively.  The purified associated-antigen binding to mAb CYL-2 was obtained from the colorectal cancer cell line Hce-8693 through immuno-affinity chromatography with mAb CYL-2.
Body mass index (BMI) is the pragmatic measure to assess children's obesity clinically and BMI charts are widely used for counselling families about children's weight management over time.  To explore the variability in clinicians' interpretation of BMI patterns and to ascertain the diagnostic accuracy of their judgement by relating it to change in body composition by dual-emission x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).  Data from 70 children who participated in a trial of a weight management programme for obese children were analysed. BMI was plotted on UK 1990 charts at baseline, 6 months and 12 months, and four clinicians experienced in obesity management independently scored the charts on a five-point scale for how successful children were in tackling their obesity over a 6-month period. Scores were compared with change in BMI, fat mass and lean mass z-scores as measured by DXA.  54 children (aged 8-15 years; BMI z-score 2.93 (SD 0.48)) had simultaneous BMI and DXA scans performed, giving 104 pairs of measurements 6 months apart. There was good consistency between clinicians' scores for weight management and these related well to change in BMI and fat mass z-scores, but not lean mass z-score. They reported that measurement proximity to centile lines and crossing of lines influenced their confidence in making a decision and change in severe obesity was harder to judge as higher centile lines are so far apart.  BMI charts are useful for assessing children's attempts at weight management, and provide a reasonably accurate indication of change in body fat. Recommendations are made regarding BMI chart design and guidance in interpreting measurements.
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary human brain tumor. GBMs are characterized by a variety of genetic alterations, among which oncogenic mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRvIII) is most common. GBMs harboring EGFRvIII have increased proliferation and invasive characteristics versus those expressing wild-type (wt) EGFR. To identify the molecular basis of this increased tumorgenic phenotype, we used iTRAQ-labeling differential proteomic analysis. Among several differentially expressed proteins, we selected CRMP1, a protein implicated in cellular invasion that was markedly decreased in GBMs expressing EGFRvIII, for further study. The differential expression of CRMP1 was confirmed in a panel of human GBM cell lines and operative specimens that express wtEGFR or mutant EGFRvIII by quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemical analysis. In human GBM samples, decreased expression of CRMP1 correlated with EGFRvIII positivity. Knockdown of CRMP1 by siRNA resulted in increased invasion of wtEGFR expressing human GBM cells (U87 and U373) to those found in isogenic GBM cells. Exogenous expression of EGFRvIII in these wtEGFR-expressing GBM cells promoted their ability to invade and was accompanied by decreased expression of CRMP1. Rescuing CRMP1 expression decreased invasion of the EGFRvIII-expressing GBM cells by tilting the balance between Rac and Rho. Collectively, these results show that the loss of CRMP1 contribute to the increased invasive phenotype of human GBMs expressing mutant EGFRvIII.
Studies were carried out on cholesterol metabolism in 11 nonobese patients and 16 obese patients with hypothyroidism and 13 with hyperthyroidism. The patients underwent several investigations under metabolic ward conditions. Hypothyroid patients usually had an increase in low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. Several mechanisms may have combined to cause a high LDL. For instance, the obese hypothyroid patients had an increase in cholesterol synthesis. Absorption of cholesterol also was increased frequently. However, other mechanisms not explored in this study probably contributed to most of the fall in LDL-cholesterol. Treatment of hypothyroid patients produced the expected fall in LDL. One possible mechanism could be that thyroid hormones enhance the conversion of cholesterol into bile acids; this mechanism has been suggested by other workers from animal studies. However, no evidence was obtained in either hypothyroid or hyperthyroid patients that thyroid hormones alter synthesis of bile acids. On the other hand, the hormones appeared to increase the synthesis of cholesterol. Patients with hypothyroidism frequently had supersaturated bile. The cause was mostly an enhanced secretion of biliary cholesterol associated with a tendency to obesity and increased synthesis of cholesterol. In contrast, the usually thin hyperthyroid patients did not have supersaturated bile. The studies show that thyroid hormones a) influence LDL-cholesterol by an action on the catabolism of LDL-independent of alterations in synthesis, catabolism, absorption, or excretion: b) stimulate synthesis of cholesterol; and c) affect biliary lipid metabolism in large part by influencing energy balance and cholesterol synthesis.
The effect of water-soluble chitosan, a natural polymer used as a dietary supplement, on human bladder-tumor cells was investigated. Apoptotic morphological change was demonstrated by nuclear staining. Chitosan-treated cells showed elevation of caspase-8-like activity, but no significant elevation of caspase-9-like activity, which suggest that proapoptotic effect of chitosan is attributable to death receptor activation and not to activation of the mitochondria-cytochrome c pathway. Chitosan increased expression of TNF-R1, but decreased Fas expression. Use of monoclonal antibodies to inhibit death-receptor signal transduction did not attenuate the proapoptotic activity of chitosan. Examination of death-ligands revealed that TNFalpha mRNA expression was markedly increased by chitosan treatment while FasL mRNA was not affected. Although the direct interaction of chitosan with death receptors remains unidentified, the results suggest that its proapoptotic effect might be related to interaction with TNFalpha or TNF-R1.
It is now widely accepted that the early-life nutritional environment is important in determining susceptibility to metabolic diseases. In particular, intra-uterine growth restriction followed by accelerated postnatal growth is associated with an increased risk of obesity, type-2 diabetes and other features of the metabolic syndrome. The mechanisms underlying these observations are not fully understood.  Using a well-established maternal protein-restriction rodent model, our aim was to determine if exposure to mismatched nutrition in early-life programmes adipose tissue structure and function, and expression of key components of the insulin-signalling pathway.  Offspring of dams fed a low-protein (8%) diet during pregnancy were suckled by control (20%)-fed dams to drive catch-up growth. This 'recuperated' group was compared with offspring of dams fed a 20% protein diet during pregnancy and lactation (control group). Epididymal adipose tissue from 22-day and 3-month-old control and recuperated male rats was studied using histological analysis. Expression and phosphorylation of insulin-signalling proteins and gene expression were assessed by western blotting and reverse-transcriptase PCR, respectively.  Recuperated offspring at both ages had larger adipocytes (P&<.001). Fasting serum glucose, insulin and leptin levels were comparable between groups but increased with age. Recuperated offspring had reduced expression of IRS-1 (P&<.01) and PI3K p110Î² (P&<.001) in adipose tissue. In adult recuperated rats, Akt phosphorylation (P&<.01) and protein levels of Akt-2 (P&<.01) were also reduced. Messenger RNA expression levels of these proteins were not different, indicating a post-transcriptional effect.  Early-life nutrition programmes alterations in adipocyte cell size and impairs the protein expression of several insulin-signalling proteins through post-transcriptional mechanisms. These indices may represent early markers of insulin resistance and metabolic disease risk.
Tumor cells can evade the immune system through several mechanisms, one of which is to block DC maturation. It has been suggested that signaling via Toll-like receptors (TLR) may be involved in the induction of prophylactic anti-cancer immunity and in the treatment of established tumors. In the present study we found that high numbers of tumor cells interfere with BMDC activation induced by the TLR ligands LPS and poly IC. Tumor cells blocked TLR3- and TLR4-mediated induction of MHCII and the co-stimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86, as well as the cytokines IL-12, TNF-alpha and IL-6. Importantly, tumor cells induced inhibitory molecules (B7-DC, B7-H1 and CD80) on spleen DC in vivo and on BMDC, even in the presence of TLR ligands. Moreover, after a long exposure with tumor cells, purified BMDC were unable to respond to a second challenge with TLR ligands. The failure of tumor exposed-BMDC to express co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines in the presence of TLR ligands has implications for the future development of DC-based cancer immune therapies using TLR ligands as adjuvants for the activation of DC.
Gel filtration of human serum extracts on Bio-Gel P-30 columns produced two peaks of material reactive with insulin antisera. The earlier eluting fraction appeared at the elution position of proinsulin (serum proinsulin-like component, PLC) while the second fraction corresponded in elution volume to insulin. In assays using porcine insulin-(131)I and an antiserum against porcine insulin, human pancreatic proinsulin was less reactive than human insulin. Serial dilutions of the serum PLC in the immunoassay showed immunological identity with the human proinsulin standard. Partial tryptic digestion of the serum PLC yielded products with increased immunological reactivity as estimated with insulin as the standard. With larger amounts of trypsin, all the serum PLC was converted to insulin-like components (desthreonine and desoctapeptide insulin). On the basis of these results we conclude that the earlier eluting fraction of human serum extracts is proinsulin. The fasting values of proinsulin in normal subjects ranged between 0.05 and 0.4 ng/ml, representing from 5 to 48% of the insulin concentration. In one subject the values of proinsulin were higher than those of insulin. After oral administration of 100 g of glucose, the proinsulin levels tended to rise similarly to insulin. Three obese patients with hyperinsulinemia had higher fasting levels of proinsulin and a greater increase after glucose than the normal subjects. As the high levels of proinsulin coexisted with raised insulin concentration in these obese subjects, the relative proportions of the two hormones were in the same range observed in the normal group. Thus hyperinsulinemia in these obese subjects was not accompanied by an increase in the fraction of serum proinsulin. When the values for serum proinsulin were expressed as percentage of the insulin levels, there was a decrease in the per cent proinsulin in the first hour of the glucose tolerance test. After the second hour, the per cent tended to rise towards the fasting levels.
Chemotherapy is the preferred therapeutic approach for advanced ovarian cancer, but a successful long-term treatment is prevented by the development of drug resistance. Recent works have underlined the involvement of non-coding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) in cancer development, with several conjectures regarding their possible involvement in the evolution of drug resistance. This study is to investigate the promoting effects and mechanism of miR-125b involved in the development of chemoresistance in ovarian cancer. The different expression of miR-125b in cisplatin-sensitive ovarian cancer cell line (OV2008) and its resistant variant (C13*) was identified by real-time PCR. An in vitro cytotoxicity assay and apoptosis assay using CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, were carried out to detect the effect of miR-125b and Bak1 on cisplatin resistance of cells. Real-time PCR, Western blotting and luciferase reporter assay were used to detect whether Bak1 is a target of miR-125b. As compared with OV2008 cells, the expression levels of miR-125b in C13* cells were increased. It was found that the up-regulation of microRNA-125b caused a marked inhibition of cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis and a subsequent increase in the resistance to cisplatin in OV2008 and C13* cells. Moreover, Bak1 was a direct target of miR-125b, and down-regulation of Bak1 suppressed cisplatin-induced apoptosis and led to an increased resistance to cisplatin. Our study indicates that miR-125b has a significantly promoting effect on chemoresistance of C13* cells and up-regulation of miR-125b expression contributes to cisplatin resistance through suppression of Bak1 expression. This finding has important implications in the development of targeted therapeutics for overcoming cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer.
This study aims to evaluate the incidence of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) in severely obese Asians and to study the impact of weight loss on OSA.  We report the results of routine preoperative Polysomnograms in 350 Asian patients undergoing bariatric surgery in our institute. Polysomnograms were repeated in 75 randomly selected patients with moderate to severe OSA after target weight loss with the laparoscopically placed adjustable gastric band (LAGB).  The prevalence of OSA in obese Asians is high. Moderate OSA was found in 46% of patients and severe OSA was found in 33%. Severe OSA was significantly more in the Chinese (46%) compared to the Malays (29%) or Indians (21%) (P = 0.035). We identified other risk factors for severe OSA (male sex, higher body mass index and the presence of hypertension) but were unable to select identifying parameters for very low (&<%) likelihood of severe OSA such that routine sleep studies prior to bariatric surgery could be omitted. Apnoea Hypoapnoea Index (AHI) showed improvement of 50% at 20 kg excess weight loss with the cure of OSA in preoperatively severe cases (P &<.005). Mild to moderate cases reported similar improvements although a direct correlation could not be established. Desaturation events, apnoea episodes, work of breathing and subjective assessment of sleepiness scores and quality of life (QOL) showed improving trends, albeit not statistically significant. Similar improvements were seen in sleep architecture with increased rapid eye movement (REM) and stage 3 sleep.  The incidence of OSA in Asians undergoing bariatric surgery is high. Routine sleep studies in Asian patients are justified. Weight loss brought about a significant improvement in AHI and continuous positive airway pressure requirements. LAGB placement should be considered a broadly effective therapy for sleep apnoea in the severely obese patient.
Low-power laser therapy has become popular in clinical applications including promoting wound healing and pain relief. However, effects of this photoradiation on human hepatoma cells are rarely studied. Previously, we found 808 nm gallium aluminum arsenide (GaAlAs) continuous wave laser had an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and J-5 at the energy density of 5.85 and 11.7 J/cm(2), respectively. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible mechanism of action of this photoradiation on HepG2 and J-5 cells. HepG2 and J-5 cells were cultured in 24-well plates for 24 h. After photoradiation by 130 mW 808 nm GaAlAs continuous wave laser for different time intervals (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 s), Western blot and immunofluorescent staining were used to examine the expression and distribution of histone and cytoskeletal proteins. The cell counts as well as histone and synemin expression of HepG2 and J-5 cells were reduced by photoradiation at the energy density of 5.85 and 11.7 J/cm(2), respectively. Furthermore, the architecture of cytoskeletons and the distribution of intermediate filament-associated proteins (plectin and synemin) were disorganized by photoradiation. Photoradiation by 808 nm GaAlAs continuous wave laser at the energy density of 5.85 and 7.8 J/cm(2) inhibited the survival of human hepatoma cell lines. The mechanism might reduce synthesis of histone and synemin. Reduced histone synthesis might further reduce the proliferation rate of these cells. Reduced synemin synthesis might result in the destruction of the cytoskeleton. Therefore, the net effects by this photoradiation were reduced cell survival.
Gynecomastia, or persistent enlargement of the male breast, is a common occurrence during early sexual development. Typically, two types of tissue can be identified during this period of growth. Initially, a dense fibrous growth of supporting stroma and breast tissue forms directly under the areola, creating a prominent mass effect. A supporting fibrofatty stroma variably develops around the periphery of the breast, particularly as the body mass index of the patient increases. Treatment is directed at both of these tissue types and includes liposuction contouring along with direct excision of the fibrous subareolar tissue. Resection of redundant skin is performed as needed either immediately or in a delayed fashion. These various modalities can be used either alone or in combination to restore a normal chest wall contour to affected individuals, thus easing the emotional burden that is associated with the condition.
An overwhelming body of research has now firmly established that the dietary intake of berry fruits has a positive and profound impact on human health, performance, and disease. Berry fruits, which are commercially cultivated and commonly consumed in fresh and processed forms in North America, include blackberry ( Rubus spp.), black raspberry ( Rubus occidentalis), blueberry ( Vaccinium corymbosum), cranberry (i.e., the American cranberry, Vaccinium macrocarpon, distinct from the European cranberry, V. oxycoccus), red raspberry ( Rubus idaeus) and strawberry ( Fragaria x ananassa). Other berry fruits, which are lesser known but consumed in the traditional diets of North American tribal communities, include chokecherry ( Prunus virginiana), highbush cranberry ( Viburnum trilobum), serviceberry ( Amelanchier alnifolia), and silver buffaloberry ( Shepherdia argentea). In addition, berry fruits such as arctic bramble ( Rubus articus), bilberries ( Vaccinuim myrtillus; also known as bog whortleberries), black currant ( Ribes nigrum), boysenberries ( Rubus spp.), cloudberries ( Rubus chamaemorus), crowberries ( Empetrum nigrum, E. hermaphroditum), elderberries ( Sambucus spp.), gooseberry ( Ribes uva-crispa), lingonberries ( Vaccinium vitis-idaea), loganberry ( Rubus loganobaccus), marionberries ( Rubus spp.), Rowan berries ( Sorbus spp.), and sea buckthorn ( Hippophae rhamnoides), are also popularly consumed in other parts of the world. Recently, there has also been a surge in the consumption of exotic "berry-type" fruits such as the pomegranate ( Punica granatum), goji berries ( Lycium barbarum; also known as wolfberry), mangosteen ( Garcinia mangostana), the Brazilian aÃ§aÃ­ berry ( Euterpe oleraceae), and the Chilean maqui berry ( Aristotelia chilensis). Given the wide consumption of berry fruits and their potential impact on human health and disease, conferences and symposia that target the latest scientific research (and, of equal importance, the dissemination of this information to the general public), on the chemistry and biological and physiological functions of these "superfoods" are necessary.
Obese patients have many physical limitations and much psychiatric burden to overcome. Several studies have shown that the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in the obese is similar to those with normal weight. However, in obese patients seeking treatment there is an increased prevalence (40-60%) of psychiatric morbidity, most commonly depression. It is difficult to separate the effects of depression on obesity and, on the contrary, the neuroendocrine changes associated with stress and depression may cause metabolic changes that predispose and perpetuate obesity. The stigma associated with obesity causes bullying in school as well as childhood psychiatric morbidity. Prejudice is not limited to the general public but exists among health professionals too. This chapter discusses the treatment of depression in obesity and the psychiatric evaluation of the pre-bariatric surgery patient. Education of society, starting with schools and including healthcare professionals will reduce bias and stigma as well as assist this vulnerable group of patients to seek help for their obesity and the many problems that come with it. Given that by the year 2025 obesity will be the world's number one health problem with the US leading the way, it is very important that we pursue preventive measures as well as encourage research for treatments of obesity.
Stimuli-responsive hydrogels have attracted considerable interest in the field of microfluidics due to their ability to transform electrical energy directly into mechanical work through swelling, bending, and other deformations. In particular, electroactive hydrogels hold great promise for biomedical micropumping applications such as implantable drug delivery systems. In such applications, energy consumption rate and durability are key properties. Here, we developed a valveless micropump system that utilizes a hydrogel as the main actuator, and tested its performance over 6 months of continuous operation. The proposed micropump system, powered by a single 1.5 V commercial battery, expended very little energy (less than 750 Î¼Ws per stroke) while pumping 0.9 wt% saline solution under a low voltage (less than 1 V), and remained fully functional after 6 months. CFD simulations were conducted to improve the microchannel geometry so as to minimize the backflow caused by the valveless mechanism of the system. Based on the simulation results, an asymmetric geometry and a stop post were introduced to enhance the pumping performance. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system as a drug delivery pump, an anti-cancer drug (adriamycin) was perfused to human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) using the pump. The present study showed that the proposed system can operate continuously for long periods with low energy consumption, powered by a single 1.5 V battery, making it a promising candidate for an implantable drug delivery system.
Advanced-stage cancers are extremely difficult to treat and rarely result in a cure. The application of oncolytic viruses is a potential strategy for controlling advanced-stage cancer because intratumoral (i.t.) injection of an oncolytic virus, such as vaccinia virus, results in tumor cell lysis and subsequent release of tumor antigens into the microenvironment. Furthermore, the viruses can serve as a vehicle for delivering genes of interest to cancer cells.  In the current study, we hypothesize that in tumor-bearing mice primed with DNA encoding an immunogenic foreign antigen, ovalbumin (OVA) followed by a boost with i.t. administration of vaccinia virus encoding the same foreign antigen, OVA, can generate enhanced antitumor effects through the combination of viral oncolysis and tumor-specific immunity.  We observed that tumor-bearing mice primed with OVA DNA and boosted with vaccinia encoding OVA (Vac-OVA) generated significant therapeutic antitumor effects as well as induced significant levels of OVA-specific CD8+ T cells in two different tumor models. Furthermore, treatment with Vac-OVA not only kills the tumor and stromal cells directly but also renders the tumor cells and surrounding stromal cells susceptible to OVA-specific CD8+ T-cell killing, resulting in enhanced antitumor therapeutic effects.  Thus, the current study may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the control of advanced-stage cancers.
Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death in the majority of developed, as well as in many developing countries. The aim of this study was to determine cardiovascular risk factors in student population and to suggest possible measures for prevention.  The study was carried out during 2007-2008 at the School of Medicine, University of Nis. It included 824 students in their final year (220 males, 604 females).  There was no significant difference in prevalence of hypertension among the male (1.81%) and female students (0%). The prevalence of obesity (Body Mass Index - BMI&> 30 kg/m2) was significantly higher (p &<0.001) in the male (7.27%) than in the female population (1.32%). Abdominal obesity was also more frequently encountered (p &<0.01) in the male (9.09%) than in female population (1.32%). Every fourth student smoked cigarettes with no significant difference between the male and female students. Alcohol consumption was a significantly higher problem (p &<0.001) in the male population (18.18%) than in the female one (2.65%). Physical inactivity was more often found (p &<0.001) in the female students (65.56%), than in male ones (36.36%). By the bivariate correlation of cardiovascular risk factors, it was determined that in the male student population systolic blood pressure correlated significantly with diastolic blood pressure, BMI and waist size, whereas age correlated with sistolic blood pressure, waist size and smoking. In the female students sistolic blood pressure correlated with diastolic blood pressure, BMI and waist size; diastolic blood pressure correlated with BMI and physical inactivity; cigarette smoking correlated with alcohol consumption and age.  Cardiovascular risk factors are present in the final-year students of the School of Medicine, University of Nis. It is necessary to insist on decreasing obesity prevalence, cigarette and alcohol consumption, and on increasing physical activity of students in order to prevent cardiovascular diseases.
MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] method is one of the most widely used methods to analyze cell proliferation and viability. It is taken up through endocytosis and is reduced by mitochondrial enzymes as well as endosomal/lysosomal compartments, then is transported to cell surfaces to form needle-like MTT formazans; however the effect of MTT itself still remains elusive. Our objective was to investigate the direct effects of MTT on in vitro SH-SY5Y cells. Results showed that the endocytosis of MTT did not cause obvious lesion and induce cell death, but the metabolism and exocytosis of MTT could dramatically damage cells. Our results also indicated that MTT could activate apoptosis related factors such as caspase-8, caspase-3 or accelerate the leakage of cell contents after the appearance of MTT formazan crystals. The present data suggest MTT method should be carefully chosen; otherwise the cell viability would be underestimated and incomparable.
This review details the history of school meals in the UK, from their origin in the mid-19th Century, to the present day, and provides a summary of how each country has independently developed its own food and or nutrient-based standards for school meals. The standards in place in the UK are amongst some of the most detailed and comprehensive in the world. Regular monitoring to ensure that these standards are being met and that schools are improving healthy eating is essential to their success. Of no lesser importance are assessments to determine whether changes to school meals are having an impact on the diets of school children. It is early days in terms of evaluation because food-based standards have only recently been introduced and nutrient-based standards are in the process of being developed and implemented. Studies in England provide some evidence that the re-introduction of standards for school food is having a positive impact on both pupil's food choices and the nutritional profile of school lunches. At present, there does not appear to be a pattern between current obesity levels and the types of school meals provided, although it is anticipated that, in the long term, these comprehensive standards may contribute to a less obesogenic environment.
A series of 3,5-bis(arylidene)-4-piperidones like chalcone analogues carrying variety of methoxylated aryl groups, pyrazolo[4,3-c]pyridines, pyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidines, and pyrido[3,2-c]pyridines, carrying an arylidene moiety, and some pyrano[3,2-c]pyridines, like flavone and coumarin isosteres, were synthesized and screened for their in-vitro antitumor activity at the National Cancer Institute (NCI, USA). The tested compounds 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, and 19 exhibited a broad spectrum of antitumor activity. Compounds belonging to the pyrazolo[4,3-c]pyridine series proved to be more active than those of the pyrido[3,2-c]pyridine and pyrano[3,2-c]pyridine analogues, in which the monomethoxylated derivatives showed better antitumor activity when compared with their corresponding dimethoxylated congeners. Compound 7 is considered to be the most active member identified in this study with a broad spectrum of activity against 22 different tumor cell lines belonging to the nine subpanels employed, and a particular effectiveness against the breast cancer T-47D cell line (GI 54.7%). The pyrano[3,2-c]pyridine heterocyclic system 19 proved to be the most active antitumor agent among the six-membered fused pyridines, with variable activity against 18 different tumor cell lines, and special activity against the non-small cell lung cancer Hop-92 and ovarian cancer OVCAR-4 cell lines (GI values 63.9 and 48.5%, respectively).
In order to survey, facilitate, and evaluate studies of medical language processing on clinical narratives, i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology to the Bedside) organized its second challenge and workshop. This challenge focused on automatically extracting information on obesity and fifteen of its most common comorbidities from patient discharge summaries. For each patient, obesity and any of the comorbidities could be Present, Absent, or Questionable (i.e., possible) in the patient, or Unmentioned in the discharge summary of the patient. i2b2 provided data for, and invited the development of, automated systems that can classify obesity and its comorbidities into these four classes based on individual discharge summaries. This article refers to obesity and comorbidities as diseases. It refers to the categories Present, Absent, Questionable, and Unmentioned as classes. The task of classifying obesity and its comorbidities is called the Obesity Challenge. The data released by i2b2 was annotated for textual judgments reflecting the explicitly reported information on diseases, and intuitive judgments reflecting medical professionals' reading of the information presented in discharge summaries. There were very few examples of some disease classes in the data. The Obesity Challenge paid particular attention to the performance of systems on these less well-represented classes. A total of 30 teams participated in the Obesity Challenge. Each team was allowed to submit two sets of up to three system runs for evaluation, resulting in a total of 136 submissions. The submissions represented a combination of rule-based and machine learning approaches. Evaluation of system runs shows that the best predictions of textual judgments come from systems that filter the potentially noisy portions of the narratives, project dictionaries of disease names onto the remaining text, apply negation extraction, and process the text through rules. Information on disease-related concepts, such as symptoms and medications, and general medical knowledge help systems infer intuitive judgments on the diseases.
To purify and characterize the colorectal cancer-associated antigen from cultured colorectal cancer cells.  The colorectal cancer cell lines that highly expressed the associated antigen were selected by flow cytometry with five specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) CYL1-5. Western blot was used to determine the binding ability of five mAbs to the associated antigens released from colorectal cells lysed with single or triplex-detergent, respectively. The mAb with highest binding ability was employed as the ligand for the immuno-affinity chromatography. The antigens purified through immuno-affinity chromatography were identified by Western blot.  The associated antigens were highly expressed on the colorectal cancer cell lines Hce-8693. The binding ability of mAb CYL-2 to the antigen was higher than that of CYL-1, CYL-3-5. The purified associated antigen binding to mAb CYL-2 was a heterodimer composed of two subunits with relative molecular mass (M(r)) of 60 x 10(3) and 70 x 10(3), respectively.  The purified associated-antigen binding to mAb CYL-2 was obtained from the colorectal cancer cell line Hce-8693 through immuno-affinity chromatography with mAb CYL-2.
The aim of this study was to survey Canadian oncology practitioners' attitudes toward psychosocial concerns and issues in women with breast cancer. Surveys were mailed to 351 medical, radiation and surgical oncologists and 375 oncology nurses. Standard questionnaires assessed attitudes towards psychosocial issues in women with primary and metastatic breast cancer and evaluated the practitioners' willingness to refer women to psychosocial intervention trials in the presence and absence of competing drug trials. Responses were obtained from 74% of those surveyed. Respondents reported being aware of the common occurrence of psychosocial problems in women with metastatic breast cancer, however, physicians were less likely than nurses to offer these women psychosocial support on a prophylactic basis (p &<0.0001) and they expressed greater concern than nurses about scientific validity of (p = 0.0003), and potential psychological damage from (p = 0.005), psychosocial support groups. Nurses were more likely than physicians to favour a study investigating group psychosocial support over competing drug studies (p &<or = 0.003) in the metastatic setting. Physicians were less likely than nurses to deal with weight problems prophylactically in women with primary breast cancer (p = 0.0009) and they expressed greater concern over scientific validity of psychosocial interventions addressing weight than nurses (p = 0.0008); nurses were more concerned about excessive expectations of patients regarding potential benefits of such interventions (p &<0.0001). Regardless, nurses were more likely than physicians to favour a psychosocial intervention study focused on weight management over drug studies in pre- (p = 0.0006) and postmenopausal women (p = 0.05) with primary breast cancer. Canadian oncology practitioners are aware of the common occurrence of psychosocial distress in women with breast cancer. Physicians and nurses assigned differing priorities to psychosocial interventions in both clinical and research situations.
Diastolic heart failure is defined clinically when signs and symptoms of heart failure are present in the presence of preserved left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction&>45%). The incidence and prevalence of primary diastolic heart failure increases with age and it may be as high as 50% in the elderly. Age, female gender, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and increased body mass index are risk factors for diastolic heart failure. Hemodynamic consequences such as increased pulmonary venous pressure, post-capillary pulmonary hypertension, and secondary right heart failure as well as decreased cardiac output are similar to those of systolic left ventricular failure, although the nature of primary left ventricular dysfunction is different. Diagnosis of primary diastolic heart failure depends on the presence of preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. Assessment of diastolic dysfunction is preferable but not mandatory. It is to be noted that increased levels of B-type natriuretic peptide does not distinguish between diastolic and systolic heart failure. Echocardiographic studies are recommended to exclude hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, infiltrative heart disease, primary valvular heart disease, and constrictive pericarditis. Myocardial stress imaging is frequently required to exclude ischemic heart disease. The prognosis of diastolic heart failure is variable; it is related to age, severity of heart failure, and associated comorbid diseases such as coronary artery disease. The prognosis of severe diastolic heart failure is similar to that of systolic heart failure. However, cautious use of diuretics and/or nitrates may cause hypotension and low output state. Heart rate control is essential to improving ventricular filling. Pharmacologic agents such as angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers are used in selected patients to decrease left ventricular hypertrophy. To decrease myocardial fibrosis, aldosterone antagonists have a potential therapeutic role. However, prospective controlled studies will be required to establish their efficacy in primary diastolic heart failure.
The use of self-monitoring as a tool to facilitate behavioral modification is common in many lifestyle-based weight loss interventions. Electronic tracking programs, including computer-based systems and smart phone applications, have been developed to allow individuals to self-monitor their behavior digitally. These programs offer an advantage over traditional self-report modalities in that they can provide users with direct feedback about dietary and/or physical activity adherence levels and thereby assist them in real-time decision making. This article describes the use of an Internet-based computerized tracking system (CTS) that was developed specifically for the POUNDS LOST study, a 2-year randomized controlled trial designed to test the efficacy of four macronutrient diets for weight and fat reduction in healthy, overweight men and women (body mass index range = 25.0-39.9 kg/m(2)). The CTS served many functions in this study, including data collection, dietary and exercise assessment and feedback, messaging system, and report generation. Across all groups, participants with high usage of the CTS during the initial 8 weeks lost greater amounts of weight than participants with low usage (8.7% versus 5.5% of initial body weight, respectively; p &<.001) at week 32. Rates of CTS utilization were highest during the first year of this 2-year intervention, and utilization of the CTS declined steadily over time. The unique features of the CTS combined with technological developments, such as smart phone applications, offer significant potential to improve the user's self-monitoring experience and adherence to health promotion programs designed specifically for individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes.
Cisplatin is one of the most potent chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of many types of solid tumours. Nevertheless, it is not the first-line drug for prostate cancer chemotherapy, because prostate tumour cells exhibit intrinsic and acquired resistance to cisplatin. We have previously demonstrated that Î²-elemene, a novel plant-derived anti-neoplastic with low toxicity, inhibits lung and ovarian carcinoma cell growth in vitro. In the present study, we explored the therapeutically chemosensitizing effect of Î²-elemene on cisplatin anti-tumour efficacy in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells as well as the underlying mechanism. Î²-Elemene significantly increased cisplatin cytotoxicity in the androgen-independent prostate carcinoma cell lines DU145 and PC-3. In addition, Î²-elemene markedly promoted cisplatin-induced apoptotic cell death in both cell lines, as determined by three different apoptosis assays. Î²-Elemene augmented the cisplatin-induced activation of caspase-3/7/10 and caspase-9, cleavage of caspase-3 and -9, suppression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L)  expression, and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria in these cells. Thus, Î²-elemene enhancement of cisplatin-induced apoptosis via mitochondrial activation of the caspase-mediated apoptotic pathway may account for the augmented anti-cancer potency of cisplatin in prostate cancer. Cisplatin combined with Î²-elemene as a chemosensitizer or adjuvant warrants further study and may be potentially useful as a first-line treatment of androgen-independent prostate carcinomas.
The aim of the work was the synthesis of gold nanoparticles (GNP) of different sizes and the estimation of their biological activity in vitro and in vivo.  Water dispersions of gold nanoparticles of different sizes have been synthesized by Davis method and characterized by laser-correlation spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy methods. The GNP interaction with tumor cells has been visualized by confocal microscopy method. The enzyme activity was determined by standard biochemical methods. GNP distribution and content in organs and tissues have been determined via atomic-absorption spectrometry method; genotoxic influence has been estimated by "Comet-assay" method.  The GNP size-dependent accumulation in cultured U937 tumor cells and their ability to modulate U937 cell membrane Na(+),K(+)-ÐÐ¢Ð -ase activity value has been revealed in vitro. Using in vivo model of Guerin carcinoma it has been shown that GNP possess high affinity to tumor cells.  Our results indicate the perspectives of use of the synthesized GNP water dispersions for cancer diagnostics and treatment. It's necessary to take into account a size-dependent biosafety level of nanoparticles.
To determine the types of subcutaneous adiposity represented by different measurements of skinfold thickness that are associated with birth weight in white (n=759), Black (n=916) and Hispanic (n=813) American children aged 5-11 y. We also determined the contribution of birth weight to ethnic differences in subcutaneous and central adiposity.  Data for this analysis were from the Third US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The outcome measures were triceps, subscapular, suprailiac and thigh skinfold thicknesses at 5-11 y of age. Central adiposity was defined as ratios of subscapular to triceps (STR) and central-peripheral (CPR) (subscapular+suprailiac)/(triceps+thigh) skinfolds. Partial correlation analyses were used to determine the association between birth weight and measures of subcutaneous fatness, while multiple linear regression analyses were used to determine the independent contribution of birth weight to ethnicity variations in subcutaneous and central adiposity adjusting for sex, age and BMI.  Overall, birth weight was negatively associated with subscapular skinfold and central adiposity in White, Black and Hispanic American children (P &<0.05). Birth weight was also negatively associated with suprailliac skinfold in both Blacks and Hispanics (P &<0.01) and with sum of the four skinfolds in Blacks (P &<0.05). Compared with White, Black ethnicity was negatively associated with triceps, suprailliac thigh and sum of skinfold thicknesses controlling for birth weight, sex, age and BMI (P &<0.01). Compared with White, Hispanic ethnicity was negatively associated with triceps, thigh and sum of skinfold thicknesses (P &<0.01). Both Black and Hispanic ethnicity was positively associated with STR and CPR (P &<0.01).  In this population of American children, the association of birth weights with subcutaneous and central fat accumulation may be due to fetal programming. Since the impact of fetal conditions is likely to be modified by life course, defining the interaction between factors that are present at birth and subsequent exposures is one of the essential challenges for future research.
Fusion of mammalian cells to form stable, non-dividing heterokaryons results in nuclear reprogramming without the exchange of genetic material. In this report, we show that reprogramming in somatic cell heterokaryons involves activation of the canonical skeletal muscle transcription factors as well as contraction-excitation genes. Thus, the effect of heterokaryon formation on gene expression is to induce a recapitulation of differentiation. Heterokaryons formed with a relatively refractory cell type, the hepatocyte cell line HepG2, revealed the importance of both MyoD expression and other unidentified cytoplasmic components, neither of which are sufficient for efficient muscle gene activation, but are synergistic. We provide evidence that de-repression by transient histone deacetylase inhibition can induce MyoD expression and increase the extent and efficiency of muscle gene transcription. Taken together, the results suggest that understanding the mechanistic basis, using a combination of approaches, and taking into account cell history, will facilitate an increase in the efficiency and fidelity of conversion from one differentiated phenotype to another desired cell type. Inherent advantages of the heterokaryon system merit further investigation in the pursuit of directed cloning.
Chitooligosaccharide (CO) has been reported to have potential antiobestic effects in a few studies, but the antiobesity properties of CO and its related mechanisms in models of dietary obesity remain unclear. We investigated the effect of CO on body weight gain, size of adipocytes, adipokines, and lipid profiles in high-fat (HF) diet-induced obese mice and on the gene expression in adipose tissue using a complementary DNA microarray approach to test the hypothesis that CO supplementation would alleviate HF diet-induced obesity by the alteration of adipose tissue-specific gene expression. Male C57BL/6N mice were fed a normal diet (control), HF diet, or CO-supplemented HF diet (1% or 3%) for 5 months. Compared with the HF diet mice, mice fed the 3% CO-supplemented diet gained 15% less weight but did not display any change in food and energy intake. Chitooligosaccharide supplementation markedly improved serum and hepatic lipid profiles. Histologic examination showed that epididymal adipocyte size was smaller in mice fed the HF + 3% CO. Microarray analysis showed that dietary CO supplementation modulated adipogenesis-related genes such as matrix metallopeptidases 3, 12, 13, and 14; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; and cathepsin k in the adipose tissues. Twenty-five percent of the CO-responsive genes identified are involved in immune responses including the inflammatory response and cytokine production. These results suggest that CO supplementation may help ameliorate HF diet-induced weight gain and improve serum and liver lipid profile abnormalities, which are associated, at least in part, with altered adipose tissue gene expression involved in adipogenesis and inflammation.
The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, also called human herpesvirus 8) has been linked to KS and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) in immunocompromised individuals. We report that PEL cell lines have constitutive active alternative NF-kappa B pathway and demonstrate high-level expression of NF-kappa B2/p100 precursor and its processed subunit p52. To elucidate the mechanism of activation of the alternative NF-kappa B pathway in PEL cells, we have investigated the role of KSHV-encoded viral Fas-associated death domain-like IL- beta 1-converting enzyme inhibitory protein (vFLIP) K13. We demonstrate that stable expression of K13, but not other FLIPs, in a variety of cell lines constitutively up-regulates p100/NF-kappa B2 expression and leads to its processing into the p52 subunit. K13-induced up-regulation and processing of p100 critically depends on the I kappa B kinase (IKK)alpha/IKK1 subunit of the IKK complex, whereas IKK beta/IKK2, receptor-interacting protein, and NF-kappa B-inducing kinase are dispensable for this process. Silencing of endogenous K13 expression by siRNA inhibits p100 processing and cellular proliferation. Our results demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that KSHV vFLIP K13 is required for the growth and proliferation of PEL cells and alternative NF-kappa B pathway plays a key role in this process. Therapeutic agents targeting the alternative NF-kappa B pathway may have a role in the treatment of KSHV-associated lymphomas.
It is unclear whether the increased risk of colon cancer associated with obesity differs for men and women, by distribution of body fat, or by location of the tumor. The primary goal of this study was to address these questions.  Eligible subjects from the Framingham Study cohort were classified according to body mass index (BMI) and waist size during two age periods: 30-54 y (n=3764) and 55-79 y (n=3802). All eligible men and women were cancer-free at baseline and had complete information on the following potential confounders: age, sex, education, height, activity, smoking, and alcohol. There were 157 incident lifetime cases of colon cancer among those followed beginning at 30-54 y of age and 149 lifetime cases among those whose follow up began at 55-79 y. Subjects were stratified further by gender, activity, and tumor location. The Cox Proportional Hazards Models were used to adjust for possible confounding by the above-described factors.  A BMI&>/=30 led to a 50% increased risk (95% CI: 0.92-2.5) of colon cancer among middle-aged (30-54 y) and a 2.4-fold increased risk (95% CI: 1.5-3.9) among older (55-79 y) adults. The BMI effect was stronger for men than for women and for cases occurring in the proximal colon. These adverse effects generally diminished when waist was added to the multivariable models. A larger waist size &>/=99.1 cm (39 in) and 101.6 cm (40 in) for women and men, respectively) was associated with a two-fold increased risk of colon cancer; this risk increased linearly with increasing waist size and was evident for both proximal and distal colon cancer. There was no attenuation of these effects when BMI was added to the multivariable models. A larger waist had a particularly adverse effect among sedentary subjects (relative risk (RR)=4.4 for middle-aged adults; RR=3.0 for older adults).  These findings suggest that waist circumference is a stronger predictor of colon cancer risk than is BMI, and that central obesity is responsible for an increased risk of cancer of both the proximal and distal colon.
Astrocyte swelling is an integral component of cytotoxic brain edema in ischemic injury. While mechanisms underlying astrocyte swelling are likely multifactorial, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are hypothesized to contribute to such swelling. We investigated the protective effects of cinnamon polyphenol extract (CPE) that has anti-oxidant and insulin-potentiating effects on cell swelling and depolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) in ischemic injury. C6 glial cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and cell volume determined using the 3-O-methyl-[3H]-glucose method at 90 min after the end of OGD. When compared with controls, OGD increased cell volume by 34%. This increase was blocked by CPE or insulin but not by blockers of oxidative/nitrosative stress including vitamin E, resveratrol, N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) or uric acid. Mitochondrial dysfunction, a key component of ischemic injury, contributes to cell swelling. Changes in DeltaPsi(m) were assessed at the end of OGD with tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE), a potentiometric dye. OGD induced a 39% decline in DeltaPsi(m) and this decline was blocked by CPE as well as insulin. To test the involvement of the mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT), we used Cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressant and a blocker of the mPT pore. CsA blocked cell swelling and the decline in DeltaPsi(m) but FK506, an immunosuppressant that does not block the mPT, did not. Our results show that CPE reduces OGD-induced cell swelling as well as the decline in DeltaPsi(m) in cultures and some of its protective effects may be through inhibiting the mPT.
Race is strongly associated with risk for metabolic dysfunction, but there is limited prospective data concerning the impact of race on antipsychotic metabolic outcomes among patients with schizophrenia.  This study is a post hoc analysis of data from a 26-week, double-blind, randomized trial of aripiprazole (N = 155) and olanzapine (N = 159) conducted from April 2000 through June 2001 in patients aged&>or= 18 years with acute schizophrenia according to DSM-IV criteria. The data were analyzed on the basis of racial breakdown: white and black/Hispanic. Between-drug and within-drug outcomes were analyzed separately for each racial cohort across weight, lipid, and glucose parameters.  For white subjects (N = 167), olanzapine significantly worsened all metabolic parameters except high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and fasting glucose, and this was significantly different than aripiprazole for every outcome except fasting glucose. In the black/Hispanic cohort (N = 137), olanzapine treatment resulted in adverse metabolic outcomes, and these changes were significantly different from aripiprazole for adiposity, total cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol. Aripiprazole decreased the odds of endpoint metabolic syndrome compared with olanzapine for all subjects (OR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.19 to 0.55), the white cohort (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.41), and black/Hispanic subjects (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.25 to 1.12), but the black/Hispanic result was not statistically significant (p = .096). Within the aripiprazole group, white subjects had significantly lower risk for metabolic syndrome, but there was no significant difference in metabolic syndrome between white and black/Hispanic subjects exposed to olanzapine.  Race may be an important moderator of metabolic risk during atypical antipsychotic therapy. Olanzapine treatment is associated with greater effects on adiposity and lipids than aripiprazole in both white and black/Hispanic subjects, suggesting that antipsychotic choice and intensive monitoring are important in minimizing metabolic risk, especially in nonwhite patients.
This study is based on and expands Newman's theory of health as expanding consciousness with women who maintained weight loss for at least 1 year. The researcher engaged in two in-depth interviews with twenty women. Individual patterns for participants who maintained weight loss revealed a personal journey of self-discovery and control with initial chaos, choice, and then emergence of behaviors reflecting expanded consciousness. Looking across participants, six patterns emerged from the data with evolution of a model of change that has implications for nursing practice at defined times within the change process of weight loss.

Information on disease-related concepts, such as symptoms and medications, and general medical knowledge help systems infer intuitive judgments on the diseases.
Tumour cell lines derived from breast cancer patients constitute one of the cornerstones of breast cancer research. To characterise breast cancer cell lines at the genetic level, we have developed a full tiling path bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) array collection for comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH). This aCGH BAC collection covers 98% of the entire human genome at a resolution of 40-60 kbp. We have used this platform alongside an in-house produced 17 K cDNA microarray set to characterise the genetic and transcriptomic profiles of 24 breast cancer cell lines, as well as cell types derived from non-diseased breast. We demonstrate that breast cancer cell lines have genomic and transcriptomic features that recapitulate those of primary breast cancers and can be reliably subclassified into basal-like and luminal subgroups. By overlaying aCGH and transcriptomic data, we have identified 753 genes whose expression correlate with copy number; this list comprised numerous oncogenes recurrently amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer (e.g., HER2, MYC, CCND1 and AURKA). Finally, we demonstrate that although breast cancer cell lines have genomic features usually found in grade III breast cancers (i.e., gains of 1q, 8q and 20q), basal-like and luminal cell lines are characterised by distinct genomic aberrations.
Depression has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) has also been identified as an independent predictor of short- and long-term cardiovascular disease events. Inflammation may influence the relationship between depression and cardiovascular disease.  The objective of this study was to investigate the association between symptoms of depression and high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) in an obese clinical population. We also sought to determine whether this relationship was different in men and women, given prior reports of a gender effect.  Symptoms of depression and hs-CRP were measured in 390 participants enrolled in a weight loss intervention trial that was delivered in a primary care setting. Symptoms of depression were evaluated with the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8), in which a score â¥ 10 is consistent with major depression.  A total of 58 (15.2%) participants reported a PHQ-8 score â¥ 10. The median (interquartile range) hs-CRP concentration was significantly higher in participants with symptoms consistent with major depression (7.7 (4.2-13) mg l(-1)) compared with those without depression (5.1 (3-9.7) mg l(-1); P&<.01). Symptoms consistent with major depression were significantly associated with log-transformed hs-CRP concentrations in an analysis adjusted for age, gender, obesity class and other metabolic variables (P=0.04). When interaction by gender was examined, this relationship remained significant in men (P&<.01) but not in women (P=0.32).  Symptoms consistent with major depression were significantly associated with hs-CRP in men only, even after adjusting for age, obesity class, metabolic variables and medications known to affect inflammation. This finding suggests that there are biologic differences between men and women that may modify the relationship between hs-CRP and depression. Further studies are needed to elucidate the biologic basis for these findings.
Identifying neighborhood environment attributes related to childhood obesity can inform environmental changes for obesity prevention.  To evaluate child and parent weight status across neighborhoods in King County (Seattle metropolitan area) and San Diego County differing in GIS-defined physical activity environment (PAE) and nutrition environment (NE) characteristics.  Neighborhoods were selected to represent high (favorable) versus low (unfavorable) on the two measures, forming four neighborhood types (low on both measures, low PAE/high NE, high PAE/low NE, and high on both measures). Weight and height of children aged 6-11 years and one parent (n=730) from selected neighborhoods were assessed in 2007-2009. Differences in child and parent overweight and obesity by neighborhood type were examined, adjusting for neighborhood-, family-, and individual-level demographics.  Children from neighborhoods high on both environment measures were less likely to be obese (7.7% vs 15.9%, OR=0.44, p=0.02) and marginally less likely to be overweight (23.7% vs 31.7%, OR=0.67, p=0.08) than children from neighborhoods low on both measures. In models adjusted for parent weight status and demographic factors, neighborhood environment type remained related to child obesity (high vs low on both measures, OR=0.41, p&<.03). Parents in neighborhoods high on both measures (versus low on both) were marginally less likely to be obese (20.1% vs 27.7%, OR=0.66, p=0.08), although parent overweight did not differ by neighborhood environment. The lower odds of parent obesity in neighborhoods with environments supportive of physical activity and healthy eating remained in models adjusted for demographics (high vs low on the environment measures, OR=0.57, p=0.053).  Findings support the proposed GIS-based definitions of obesogenic neighborhoods for children and parents that consider both physical activity and nutrition environment features.

Melanocytes express MITF, which is crucial for the development of the melanocyte lineage and is overexpressed in malignant melanomas. Adenoviral E1A protein-expressing melanocytes are unpigmented, with the expression of MITF being silenced. We tested here a direct repression of the melanocyte-specific MITF promoter by E1A and its mutants. We found that the extreme N-terminus and conserved region 1 are required for repression. In contrast, the motif in conserved region 2 (a.a. 122-126), as well as amino acids 26-35 at the N-terminus, are not necessary. As these two later motifs mediate E1A binding to the retinoblastoma protein or to the transcriptional co-activator TRRAP, respectively, and are important for transformation by E1A in cooperation with other oncogenes, the results suggest that the transformation-defective E1A can still efficiently repress the MITF promoter. The CREB binding motif-mutated promoter had lower activity, but was also repressed by the same E1A mutants in human melanoma cells. The E1A protein is known to also exert an antitumour activity, which is associated with its transcription repression function and the ability to induce apoptosis, and is a potential antimelanoma agent. Since recent data suggest that MITF may be a survival factor for melanoma cells, the E1A mutants described here might constitute a good targeting agent for antimelanoma therapy.
Madelung's disease, or multiple symmetric lipomatosis, is an extremely rare disease and very likely to be under-diagnosed. It is characterized by multiple symmetrical non-encapsulated fat accumulations mainly located around the neck, shoulders, upper extremities and upper parts of the trunk. The disorder predominantly affects middle-aged men of Mediterranean origin with a history of ethanol intake. Reports of this uncommon disorder in women are very rare. The aim of this article is to report the endocrine and metabolic workup leading to the diagnosis of this uncommon disorder. A 55-year-old woman with osteoporosis was referred to our outpatient clinic with a suspected diagnosis of Cushing's disease. The patient complained of undesired weight gain with atypical fat accumulations predominantly in the upper trunk region during the previous 10 weeks. She presented with the characteristic physical features of Madelung's disease and underwent a thorough examination with endocrine and metabolic evaluation of this rare condition and was finally diagnosed with Madelung's disease. This report demonstrates how a diagnosis of this rare disorder can be reached efficiently. A history of osteoporosis in combination with weight gain and atypical fat accumulations ultimately led to the diagnosis of Madelung's diseases, a rather unknown disorder likely to be under-diagnosed. Although treatment options are limited, a diagnosis is still important for the affected individual.

The data were analyzed on the basis of racial breakdown: white and black/Hispanic. Between-drug and within-drug outcomes were analyzed separately for each racial cohort across weight, lipid, and glucose parameters.  For white subjects (N = 167), olanzapine significantly worsened all metabolic parameters except high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and fasting glucose, and this was significantly different than aripiprazole for every outcome except fasting glucose. In the black/Hispanic cohort (N = 137), olanzapine treatment resulted in adverse metabolic outcomes, and these changes were significantly different from aripiprazole for adiposity, total cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol. Aripiprazole decreased the odds of endpoint metabolic syndrome compared with olanzapine for all subjects (OR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.19 to 0.55), the white cohort (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.41), and black/Hispanic subjects (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.25 to 1.12), but the black/Hispanic result was not statistically significant (p = .096). Within the aripiprazole group, white subjects had significantly lower risk for metabolic syndrome, but there was no significant difference in metabolic syndrome between white and black/Hispanic subjects exposed to olanzapine.  Race may be an important moderator of metabolic risk during atypical antipsychotic therapy. Olanzapine treatment is associated with greater effects on adiposity and lipids than aripiprazole in both white and black/Hispanic subjects, suggesting that antipsychotic choice and intensive monitoring are important in minimizing metabolic risk, especially in nonwhite patients.
Astrocyte swelling is an integral component of cytotoxic brain edema in ischemic injury. While mechanisms underlying astrocyte swelling are likely multifactorial, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are hypothesized to contribute to such swelling. We investigated the protective effects of cinnamon polyphenol extract (CPE) that has anti-oxidant and insulin-potentiating effects on cell swelling and depolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) in ischemic injury. C6 glial cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and cell volume determined using the 3-O-methyl-[3H]-glucose method at 90 min after the end of OGD. When compared with controls, OGD increased cell volume by 34%. This increase was blocked by CPE or insulin but not by blockers of oxidative/nitrosative stress including vitamin E, resveratrol, N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) or uric acid. Mitochondrial dysfunction, a key component of ischemic injury, contributes to cell swelling. Changes in DeltaPsi(m) were assessed at the end of OGD with tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE), a potentiometric dye. OGD induced a 39% decline in DeltaPsi(m) and this decline was blocked by CPE as well as insulin. To test the involvement of the mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT), we used Cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressant and a blocker of the mPT pore. CsA blocked cell swelling and the decline in DeltaPsi(m) but FK506, an immunosuppressant that does not block the mPT, did not. Our results show that CPE reduces OGD-induced cell swelling as well as the decline in DeltaPsi(m) in cultures and some of its protective effects may be through inhibiting the mPT.
The proteolytic activity of Furin responsible for processing full length Notch-1 (p300) plays a critical role in Notch signaling. The amplitude and duration of Notch activity can be regulated at various points in the pathway, but there has been no report regarding regulation of the Notch-1-Furin interaction, despite its importance. In the present study, we found that the Notch-1-Furin interaction is regulated by the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Src. c-Src and Notch-1 are physically associated, and this association is responsible for Notch-1 processing and activation. We also found that growth factor TGF-Î±, an EGFR ligand, and PDGF-BB, a PDGFR ligand, induce the Notch-1-Furin interaction mediated by c-Src. Our results support three new and provocative conclusions: (1) The association between Notch-1 and Furin is a well-regulated process; (2) Extracellular growth factor signals regulate this interaction, which is mediated by c-Src; (3) There is cross-talk between the plasma growth factor receptor-c-Src and Notch pathways. Co-localization of Notch-1 and c-Src was confirmed in xenograft tumor tissues and in the tissues of pancreatic cancer patients. Our findings have implications for the mechanism by which the Notch and growth factor receptor-c-Src signaling pathways regulate carcinogenesis and cancer cell growth.
Adult neural stem cells (NSCs) are known to exist in a few regions of the brain; however, the entity and physiological/disease relevance of adult hypothalamic NSCs (htNSCs) remain unclear. This work shows that adult htNSCs are multipotent and predominantly present in the mediobasal hypothalamus of adult mice. Chronic high-fat-diet feeding led to not only depletion but also neurogenic impairment of htNSCs associated with IKKÎ²/NF-ÎºB activation. In vitro htNSC models demonstrated that their survival and neurogenesis markedly decreased on IKKÎ²/NF-ÎºB activation but increased on IKKÎ²/NF-ÎºB inhibition, mechanistically mediated by IKKÎ²/NF-ÎºB-controlled apoptosis and Notch signalling. Mouse studies revealed that htNSC-specific IKKÎ²/NF-ÎºB activation led to depletion and impaired neuronal differentiation of htNSCs, and ultimately the development of obesity and pre-diabetes. In conclusion, adult htNSCs are important for the central regulation of metabolic physiology, and IKKÎ²/NF-ÎºB-mediated impairment of adult htNSCs is a critical neurodegenerative mechanism for obesity and related diabetes.
The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, also called human herpesvirus 8) has been linked to KS and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) in immunocompromised individuals. We report that PEL cell lines have constitutive active alternative NF-kappa B pathway and demonstrate high-level expression of NF-kappa B2/p100 precursor and its processed subunit p52. To elucidate the mechanism of activation of the alternative NF-kappa B pathway in PEL cells, we have investigated the role of KSHV-encoded viral Fas-associated death domain-like IL- beta 1-converting enzyme inhibitory protein (vFLIP) K13. We demonstrate that stable expression of K13, but not other FLIPs, in a variety of cell lines constitutively up-regulates p100/NF-kappa B2 expression and leads to its processing into the p52 subunit. K13-induced up-regulation and processing of p100 critically depends on the I kappa B kinase (IKK)alpha/IKK1 subunit of the IKK complex, whereas IKK beta/IKK2, receptor-interacting protein, and NF-kappa B-inducing kinase are dispensable for this process. Silencing of endogenous K13 expression by siRNA inhibits p100 processing and cellular proliferation. Our results demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that KSHV vFLIP K13 is required for the growth and proliferation of PEL cells and alternative NF-kappa B pathway plays a key role in this process. Therapeutic agents targeting the alternative NF-kappa B pathway may have a role in the treatment of KSHV-associated lymphomas.
To investigate the sustained release rule of doxorubicin/polylactide-grafted dextran copolymer (DOX/DEX-PLA) nanoparticles and the effect thereof in killing hepatocarcinoma cells.  DOX/DEX-PLA nanoparticles were prepared by method of emulsification & evaporation of organic solvent. Its morphology was observed by transmission electron microscopy and the encapsulating efficiency of DOX was determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. DOX/DEX-PLA was put in a dialysis bag to observe the releasing characteristics of DOX from DOX/DEX-PLA nanoparticles in vitro. Human liver carcinoma cells of the line HepG2 were cultured with DOX/DEX-PLA of different concentrations or the original drug of DOX as control group for 24, 36, or 48 h. MTT method was used to observe the cancer inhibition rate. BALB/c nude mice underwent subcutaneous injection of HepG2 cells at the right scapula and then randomly divided into 4 groups to undergo intravenous injection of DOX/DEX-PLA (excremental group), original drug of DOX (naked drug group), DEX-PLA (nanovector group), or normal saline (blank control group) once every 5 days for 3 times. Twenty-one days later the mice were killed with the tumors taken out to measure the weight to analyze the inhibitory effect against hepatocarcinoma cells.  The DOX/DEX-PLA nanoparticles were of round or elliptical shape with the diameter of about 83 nm, and the DOX entrapment efficiency was about 67.1%. The releasing test in vitro manifested a sustained release of over 50% of DOX encapsulated in DOX/DEX-PLA nanoparticles for about 7 days. Both the DOX/DEX-PLA nanoparticles and naked drug DOX inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells with a similar inhibitory rate (51.3% vs 50.7%, P > 0.05), meanwhile the DEX-PLA nanovector failed to inhibit the HepG2 cells. In-vivo experiment showed an inhibitory rate of DOX/DEX-PLA nanoparticles on hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts of 68.56%, significantly higher than that of the naked drug DOX (48.17%).  DOX/DEX-PLA nanoparticles can effectively inhibit the growth of hepatocarcinoma cells.
The androgen receptor (AR) plays a central role in the development and progression of prostate cancer. AR expression is maintained throughout the progression of prostate cancer and is also associated with an aggressive, castration-resistant (CR) phenotype. Despite the critical roles of AR expression in prostate cancer progression, the exact signaling mechanism regulating AR expression remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that AR expression was increased by a low-affinity leukotriene B(4) receptor (BLT2)-linked pathway. We found that BLT2 was overexpressed in AR-positive prostate cancer cells, such as LNCaP cells, and BLT2 inhibition, using an inhibitor or siRNA knockdown, clearly attenuated AR expression and triggered apoptosis in these cells. These results suggest a role for BLT2 in AR expression and the survival of AR-positive prostate cancer cells. Moreover, we found that the NADPH oxidase family protein, Nox4, lay downstream of BLT2 and mediated the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent NF-ÎºB stimulation, thereby inducing AR expression. Taken together, our results demonstrate that BLT2 plays a critical role in AR expression via a Nox4-ROS-NF-ÎºB-linked pathway, thereby mediating the survival of AR-positive prostate cancer cells. Our findings point to BLT2 as a key regulator of AR expression and will contribute to the development of novel therapies for AR-positive prostate cancers, including androgen-responsive and CR prostate cancers.
Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is recognized as an important factor involved in the tumor malignancy progression. Our previous study has indicated that the hepatocarcinoma cell line with 75% of LNM (Hca-F)-cell-induced neoplasia and the hepatocarcinoma cell line with 25% of LNM-induced neoplasia are accompanied with high (75%) and low (25%) incidences of LNM. In the current study, 62 and 54 protein spots were observed up-regulated and down-regulated in Hca-F cell relative to the hepatocarcinoma cell line with 25% of LNM by 2-D DIGE. Totally, 113 unique proteins were identified by HPLC-nano ESI-MS/MS analysis. The expression levels of Annexin A7, Ulch3, and ER protein 29 were validated by Western blotting analyses. The abnormally regulated proteins were categorized and annotated by protein analysis through evolutionary relationships analysis with the aid of the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery tool. Seventeen gene candidates concordantly expressed both at mRNA and protein levels. By making a challenge, we detected expression levels of Annexin A7 in primary gastric cancer (GC) and primary GC cancer tissues with LNMs by immunohistochemisty. Higher ratio of positive and strong expressions Annexin A7 in GC might correlate with the tumor progression. The repression of Annexin A7 inhibits the mobility and invasion abilities of Hca-F cell, increases the apoptosis rate of Hca-F cell. Current study narrows and provides certain specific protein candidates potentially playing important roles in LNM-associated cancers.

A series of 3,5-bis(arylidene)-4-piperidones like chalcone analogues carrying variety of methoxylated aryl groups, pyrazolo[4,3-c]pyridines, pyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidines, and pyrido[3,2-c]pyridines, carrying an arylidene moiety, and some pyrano[3,2-c]pyridines, like flavone and coumarin isosteres, were synthesized and screened for their in-vitro antitumor activity at the National Cancer Institute (NCI, USA). The tested compounds 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, and 19 exhibited a broad spectrum of antitumor activity. Compounds belonging to the pyrazolo[4,3-c]pyridine series proved to be more active than those of the pyrido[3,2-c]pyridine and pyrano[3,2-c]pyridine analogues, in which the monomethoxylated derivatives showed better antitumor activity when compared with their corresponding dimethoxylated congeners. Compound 7 is considered to be the most active member identified in this study with a broad spectrum of activity against 22 different tumor cell lines belonging to the nine subpanels employed, and a particular effectiveness against the breast cancer T-47D cell line (GI 54.7%). The pyrano[3,2-c]pyridine heterocyclic system 19 proved to be the most active antitumor agent among the six-membered fused pyridines, with variable activity against 18 different tumor cell lines, and special activity against the non-small cell lung cancer Hop-92 and ovarian cancer OVCAR-4 cell lines (GI values 63.9 and 48.5%, respectively).
