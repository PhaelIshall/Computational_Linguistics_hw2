# Computational_Linguistics_hw2
We will first build our own bigram language model, then create language models with a state-of-the-art tool which provides flexible smoothing options. We will make use of the language models in a specific task (predict the relative difficulty of a text). We will compare the power of different types of language models for the task and will examine some of the properties of the texts related to lexical use.
